# Understanding Check

In `Understanding.java`, there are two sets of loops that successfully print a desired output. Unfortunately though, they are not doing it very efficiently.

Modify both sets of loops to run more efficiently (fewer boolean checks), without changing their output.

Before trying, run the program and look at the produced output to pick up on the patterns they are highlighting.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
