# AP Computer Science A - Unit 4 Section 5

# Informal Code Analysis

This section takes a step back from writing code and delves into analyzing how code will run by evaluating how often different lines of code are executed/run.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- Statement Execution Counts
- Informal Runtime Analysis

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
