# AP Computer Science A - Unit 5 Section 1

# Anatomy of a Class

This section takes a step back from our normal programming and tries to look at the bigger picture of object-oriented programming by looking at what makes up a `class`.

This section covers the following material:

- Breaking Down a Class
    - Variables
    - Constructors
    - Methods
- `public` vs. `private`
- Data Encapsulation

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
